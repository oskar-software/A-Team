                            <p>The main telescope is a 400mm (16inch) Dobsonian reflector that was acquired in 2013. The observatory also houses a Victorian 0.25m (10 inch) Cooke refractor, with a focal length of 3.75 m. It was made in York in 1871 by Thomas
                                Cooke and the optical components are of the highest quality. The telescope is actually older than the building. The dome also houses a 0.3m (12 inch) Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope, which was purchased in 2006.</p>

                            <p>The Mills Observatory in Dundee, Scotland, is the first purpose-built public astronomical observatory in the UK. Built in 1935, the observatory is classically styled in sandstone and has a distinctive 7 m dome, which houses
                                a Victorian refracting telescope, a small planetarium, and display areas. The dome is one of two made from papier-mâché to survive in the UK, the other being at the Godlee Observatory.</p>

                                information about the galaxy, the friendly staff at Mills have the answers. There are also displays on the solar system and space exploration. From April to September, Mills is open on selected dates.</p>

                            <p>The subsequent international design competition to create a new building was won in July 1996 by Richard Murphy Architects. The resulting building was instantly hailed as an innovative modern space. The final cost of the construction
                                was £9 million. The centre currently receives approximately 380,000 visitors per year and in 2016 was listed in the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland (RIAS) top 10 of Scotland's top 100 buildings of the 20th
                                century.
